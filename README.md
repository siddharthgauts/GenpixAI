# Hi Everyone,

Here is my web app that I had made using TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Node.js and many frameworks.
This is one of the best projects I have made. Coming to the point, GenpixAI converts any input text into an image.

I have also implemented a suggestion section so the website can suggest what is likely to be input.

Talking about APIs, I have implemented ChatGPT as well as DALL-E API together, which is really cool. 
I have hosted this on Microsoft Azure, which gives $100 free credit on the student development pack by GitHub.

It has many additional features like Refresh Images, Use Suggestion, New Suggestion. You can visit my GenpixAI site and explore more about its features.

Below are the Frontend UI as well as backend server along with test samples that have been generated by GenpixAI.

Note: My Azure Student credit of $100 is over on 20/09/2023. As Soon as I get Credits the site will be live again.
