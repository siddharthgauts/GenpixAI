# Hi Everyone,

Here is my web app that I had made using TypeScript, HTML, CSS, Node.js, and many more languages and frameworks.
This is one of the best projects I have made. Coming to the point, GenpixAI converts any input text into an image.

I have also implemented a suggestion section so the website can suggest what is likely to be input.

Talking about APIs, I have implemented ChatGPT as well as DALL-E API together, which is really cool. 
I have hosted this on Microsoft Azure, which gives $100 free credit on the student development pack by GitHub.

It has many additional features that I am not mentioning, but you can definitely visit my GenpixAI site and explore more details and features.

Below are the Frontend UI as well as backend server along with test samples that have been generated by GenpixAI.
